            <h2>A little bit about myself...</h2>
            <p> My name is Ameilia Valdes and I am 24 years old. I currently live in Kirkland. I have a pet tortoise, named Tobias, that I've had for 8 years, and a cat, Seraphina, who is just about a year old. I graduated from Shoreham Wading River Highschool in 2014. I got my Associate's Degree in General Studies from Suffolk County Community College in 2016. Both of these schools are on Long Island, New York, where I grew up for most of my life. I moved out here to Washington in the spring of 2017. For the last 3 years I've been working in the Food and Hospitality Industry, more specifically fine dining, for the Heavy Restaurants Group. My goal is to complete this program and switch my focus to a career in tech.</p>
